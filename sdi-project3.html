<p>I chose to change my story this week, to a weeding theme. I was running into limitations when doing week two's assignment, so I thought it best to come up with another story line. I attended a friends wedding this past weekend and it reminded me of planning for my wedding.</p>
<p>At this point I'm not sure if I'm going to use the theme as "planning" a wedding or the actual "wedding" itself. We will see how the coding comes along and see which will be easier. I'll update this once I have a better understanding of which story would be easier to code for.</p>
